# sw-react-uimockup
React Web Application based on a UI mockup given by Saleswhale. 
The challenge was to implement an app that looks as close as possible to the attached mockup.

Hosted on GitHub pages at: https://mohawker.github.io/sw-react-dashboard/  
Heroku Mock API (JSON-Server) is hosted at: https://sw-test-api.herokuapp.com/  
**Do note the server will be asleep from 2.30 am to 8.30 am (GMT +8 // SG Time Zone)

Alternatively, you can view the web application by cloning the repo and running the following commands: 
(note the directory is `sw-react-uimockup`)

```
cd sw-react-uimockup
npm install
npm start
```

###### Libraries Used:
- axios (fetching mock API data)
- react-spring (wanted to learn an animation library while undertaking this project)
